# A Topology of Two-Person Games and Evolutionary Dynamics of Iterated Play

The Prisoner’s Dilemma has been the focus of much research in the field of Game theory with
countless papers analysing its characteristics and applications. Its ability to model strategic
conflict however, is not unique. This infamous dilemma is part of a broad class of games,
most of which often go unexplored. In this paper, we introduce this class of two-person noncooperative non-zero-sum games known as 2×2 strict ordinal games. Exploring the space of
games and constructing a coherent topology, we aim to identify the similarities and differences
between the various strategic situations of conflict and cooperation they represent. Following
from the interest in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, we develop a Markov model for simulating
iterated play for a broader range of games. Through the analysis of these simulations, we look
to assess the correlation between successful strategy selection and the relationships between
2×2 games. We also present an alternative approach to strategy selection through the more
recent study of evolutionary game theory. Analysing the replicator dynamics of two-population
systems, we look to develop a toolkit for the analysis of asymmetric games.
